# Heart-disease-Risk-Assessment
This AI-powered system predicts heart disease using key health attributes like BMI, age, and blood pressure. Three machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM—are trained and evaluated, with the most accurate model selected. Through data preprocessing, visualization, and comparative analysis, this project enhances early diagnosis and medical decision-making
